In this guide I share best practices for a successful Froggodoggo profile that's sure to peak the interest of companies looking to hire.

On Froggodoggo, companies browse through the various profiles of founders who are looking for a side gig. The profiles they see are based on a series of question we ask the founders to answer. Currently we ask the following:

* What are your top 5 tech skills?
* What does your company do (in one sentence)?
* What have you done so far?
* What's the coolest thing you worked on?
* What's the most impressive thing you've built?
* What is not important now but will be in 5 years?

In general, it's always a good idea to keep your answers concise, short and relevant. This is not only true for Froggodoggo, but for communicating in life in general. With these general tips in mind, let's dive into the specific questions.

## What are your top 5 tech skills?
This is more a list than a free text answer, but it's still important to think about what is relevant in this context. If you are positioning yourself as a front-end engineering, maybe don't mention your Visual Basic skills (it might seem obvious, but you'd be surprised). Talk about your JavaScript and React experience, instead.

## What does your company do (in one sentence)?
Refrain from marketing speak and buzzwords. Just tell factually what your company is doing. A good answer is: *"We help people adopt cats and dogs by making the adoption process quick and easy."*. A bad answer is: *"We're re-inventing the way humans and pets live together."*. You get my point.

## What have you done so far?
This answer is like your mini bio. It's important to keep it short and focus on few of the most relevant things you have done in your professional life. For example:

*"I've launched my current startup in October and we now have 2,000 monthly active users just through word-of-mouth. Before starting this company, I was a software engineer at Netflix for 3 years where I worked on improving the recommendation algorithm. My team there helped increase user engagement rates by 80%."*

## What's the coolest thing you worked on?
This question gives you the opportunity to highlight something you did that you think is fun and cool. Work is not always serious, and people like to be around fun folks. For example:

*"During an internal Netflix hackathon, I worked on a browser plugin which let you easily record funny voice overs while streaming content on Netflix. For obvious legal reasons, we never released it :)"*

## What's the most impressive thing you've built?
Time to show off. This doesn't need to be in a professional context. It can be a university project, or something that you did as a kid. For example:

*"I'm proud that I launched my current company super quickly. It took me 1 month from idea to first real users, and then another two weeks for first paying customer."*

## What is not important now but will be in 5 years?
Here you can show if you have any interesting, controversial or surprising views and insights. For example:

*"Virtual reality. I use it every day,  but many people see it as a toy, but soon it will replace the laptop for many users, change the way we socialize online for the better, and will have immense impact on improving education."*


## And finally...
Be honest and don't take yourself too seriously :-)
